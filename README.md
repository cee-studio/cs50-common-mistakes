# Mistakes of CS50 C psets

These are collections of mistakes made by CS50x students in their C
psets. The first category is for the mistakes that cause memory
errors (e.g., segmentation faults) and memory leaks. The second
category is for the mistakes that do not cause memory errors but
produce incorrect results.

Contributions are welcome.

The contribution guidelines:

1. Obtain the entire source code for each mistake
2. Use https://cee.studio to create an executable demo link<sup>*</sup>
3. Describe briefly each mistake
4. Include the original post link (if it's possible)
